Description: This package is intended to manipulate CLIPSeq data and summarize them along genomic regions. Typically, it can be used to draw RNA splice map such as those found in licatalosi et al. or using other summarize functions. It allows to select a chromosome, strand and interval of interest. It provides numerical and graphical output about the coverage of splice sites and their surroundings.
